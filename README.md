This is a personal project that I developed to further my knowledge on C language and Simple Direct Library 2 (SDL2).

This project helped me dip my toes in topics such as frame rate, Music, SFX, real-time input handling and rendering.

To build, use the build.bat file in the project's root directory.
To play the game, run the rootDirectory/Bin/game.exe or run the RunGame.bat file.

All the code is in one file found in /Source/main.c
